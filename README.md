# Data-Dashboard-with-excel
This project features an incredibly detailed and insightful dataset of individuals, capturing a wide range of personal and demographic information, such as income, gender, number of children, education level, occupation, homeownership status, number of cars, commute distance, region, age bracket, and whether or not they purchased a bike. With this rich data, we’ve built an interactive Excel dashboard that transforms raw information into powerful visualizations, making it easy to uncover patterns and trends. Whether you're exploring consumer behavior or analyzing market segments, this dashboard offers an impressive, user-friendly way to dive into the factors influencing bicycle purchases. It’s not just data – it’s a comprehensive, visual exploration of real-world consumer profiles!
